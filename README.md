# Card2Brain Flashcard Scraper

Automatically grabs the flashcards and saves them as PNGs so that they can be used offline or for other needs when the built in features of the site don't work as intended.

## Installing

Either install from the [Releases](https://github.com/illuminat3/card2brain-flashcard-scraper/releases) page or manually clone the repo and run it locally.
